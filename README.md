### Project Description

This work describes the creation of a virtual environment and setting up a git repository for the project. Also at this stage, exploratory data analysis is carried out.

### Project launch

Initially, we need to go to the folder into which we want to copy our project, or specify the required folder when cloning. This can be done using the command:

**git clone url path/folder**

To create a virtual environment (using Python), you need to run the following commands:

**python3 -m venv path/folder**
**source path/folder/bin/activate**

To install all the necessary libraries in the virtual environment, you must use the command:
**pip install -r requirements.txt**
